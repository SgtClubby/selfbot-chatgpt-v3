# ChatGPT

## How can I use ChatGPT?

First and foremost, this ChatGPT is private. Additionally, ChatGPT does not support self-hosting without alot of additional setup, so running a copy yourself is not advised.

## About this repository

The code here is not strictly and routinely kept up to date. Running this code on your own is not supported; I will not be providing the resources necessary to self-host.
